# This is Ori & Shay Pokedex Project.

# You can see our website here: https://shay-ori-pokedex.herokuapp.com/

# To initiate the project in your local computer:

# 1. Open the 'mongo.ts' file and insert your connect details in 'connectToAtlas' function.

# 2. Open the 'server.ts' file in line '35' and change the condition 'false' - to 'true'.

# 3. Open terminal in server folder and do this command: 'npm start'

# 4. Now it's maybe take some time until all pokemons will upload to your Atlas, after this, the function 'initServer' on 'server.ts' file will pull the data from Atlas. After this the server will be up and running :)
