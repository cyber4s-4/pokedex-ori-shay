# This is Ori's & Shay's Pokedex Project.

# To initiate The Project:

# 1. Open the 'mongo.ts' file and insert your credentials in the 'connectToAtlas' function.

# 2. Open the 'server.ts' file in line '35' and change the condition from 'false' to 'true'.

# 3. Open a terminal in the server folder and run: 'npm start'

# 4. Now it might take some time until all pokemons will upload to your Atlas, after this, the function 'initServer' on 'server.ts' file will pull the data from Atlas. After that the server will be up and running :)
